## Reporting a Vulnerability

Go through Github's mechanism to report a private vulnerability via the
Security tab. I'll receive a notification and get to it within a week or
so at most. It's a standalone app built on Vite + React on gh_pages so 
I assume any vulnerabilities coming  in will be from dependabot.
